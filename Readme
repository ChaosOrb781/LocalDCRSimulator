Simple DCR simulator utilizing the dcrgraph.net web API to fetch graphs and use their login system.

Currently it supports all relations apart from "Spawns" relation, which is intended for subprocesses. I do not intend to include this as part of the simulator unless others may find a need for it.

Timed relations and activities requiring input are not supported either, it is meant as a simply "here is an activity, do that, see if valid" checker

How the project works:

1. Looks for any .csv files within a certain depth of folders (current 3 folders up) meaning you can place it in the main directory and still run it through visual studio where it will be fetched from the .exe that gets generated in bin/Debug
2. Ask for credentials, these are your credentials for dcrgraph.net, only graphs you have access to or are public can be fetched
3. Ask for ID(-s) of the graphs to run over the found .csv files
4. Shows progress as it runs through each track, currently the columns for the .csv file are defined as:
  (a) "ID" : contains the traces' unique id
  (b) "Event" : contains a unique id for each activity
  (c) "Title" : label of the activity to perform
  (d) "Date" : Date column used to sort the events in order of execution
5. Writes result back to the same folder as the log file was found with appropriate naming

On another note, it also has a Logfile next to the location of the .exe that stores up to 1MB of logging data from running the program. This can be useful for debugging.
